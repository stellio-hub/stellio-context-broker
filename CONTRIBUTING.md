# Contributing to Stellio

Thanks for checking out the Stellio Project. We're excited to hear and learn from you. We've put together the following
guidelines to help you figure out where you can best be helpful.

## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

-   Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and
    projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others
    rather than convince them that your way is correct.
-   This project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this
    project, you agree to abide by its terms.
-   If you open a pull request, you must sign the
    [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://fiware.github.io/contribution-requirements/individual-cla.pdf) by
    stating in a comment _"I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA"_
-   Please ensure that your contribution passes all tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address them
    before we can merge your contribution.
-   When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please don't add references or links to things you or
    your employer have created as others will do so if they appreciate it.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/stellio-hub/stellio-context-broker/issues) and
[pull requests](https://github.com/stellio-hub/stellio-context-broker/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or
question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:

-   **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
-   **If your contribution is major,** such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can
    weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

## Community

Discussions about the Open Source Guides take place on this repository's
[Issues](https://github.com/stellio-hub/stellio-context-broker/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/stellio-hub/stellio-context-broker/pulls)
sections. Anybody is welcome to join these conversations.
