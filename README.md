Stellio is an NGSI-LD compliant context broker developed by EGM. NGSI-LD is an Open API and Datamodel specification for 
context management [published by ETSI](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/CIM/001_099/009/01.02.02_60/gs_CIM009v010202p.pdf).

This project is part of [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/). For more information check the FIWARE Catalogue entry for
[Core Context](https://github.com/Fiware/catalogue/tree/master/core).

## Overview

Stellio is composed of 3 business services:
* Entity service is in charge of managing the information context, it is backed by a [neo4j](https://neo4j.com) database
* Search service is in charge of handling the temporal (and geospatial) queries, it is backed by a [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/) database
* Subscription service is in charge of managing subscriptions and subsequent notifications, it is backed by a [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/) database

It is completed with:
* An API Gateway module that dispatches requests to downstream services
* A [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) streaming engine that decouples communication inside the broker (and allows plugging other services seamlessly)

The services are based on the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) framework, developed in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org),
and built with [Gradle](https://gradle.org).

## Quick start

A quick way to start using Stellio is to use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory (feel free to change 
the default passwords defined in the `.env` file):

```shell script
docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
```

It will start all the services composing the Stellio context broker platform and expose them on the following ports:
* API Gateway: 8080
* Entity service: 8082
* Search service: 8083
* Subscription service: 8084

Please note that the environment and scripts are validated on Ubuntu 19.10 and MacOS. Some errors may occur on other platforms.

## Development

### Developing on a service

Requirements:
* Java 11 (we recommend using [sdkman!](https://sdkman.io/) to install and manage versions of the JDK)

To develop on a specific service, you can use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file inside each service's directory, for instance:

```shell script
cd entity-service
docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
```

Then, from the root directory, launch the service:

```shell script
./gradlew entity-service:bootRun
```

### Running the tests

Each service has a suite of unit and integration tests. You can run them without manually launching any external component, thanks
to Spring Boot embedded test support and to the great [TestContainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) library.

For instance, you can launch the test suite for entity service with the following command:
 
```shell script
./gradlew entity-service:test
```

### Building the project

To build all the services, you can just launch:

```shell script
./gradlew build
```

It will compile the source code, check the code formatting (thanks to [ktLint](https://ktlint.github.io/)) and run the test
suite for all the services.

For each service, a self executable jar is produced in the `build/libs` directory of the service.

If you want to build only one of the services, you can launch:

```shell script
./gradlew entity-service:build
```

### Formatting the code

To format the code, we use Intellij built-in formatter with settings that can be found in the `config/settings` directory.

Import settings with `File/Manage IDE Settings/Import Settings...`.

You can use plugins like [Save Actions](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7642-save-actions) that applies changed code refactoring and optimized imports on a save.

### Working locally with Docker images

To work locally with a Docker image of a service without publishing it to Docker Hub, you can follow the below instructions:

* Build a tar image:

```shell script
./gradlew entity-service:jibBuildTar
```

* Load the tar image into Docker:

```shell script
docker load --input entity-service/build/jib-image.tar
```

* Run the image:

```shell script
docker run stellio/stellio-entity-service:latest
```

# Usage

To start using Stellio, you can follow the [API quick guide](https://github.com/easy-global-market/ngsild-api-data-models/blob/master/API_Quick_Guide.md)
published in our NGSI-LD API & Data Model repository.

As the development environment does not make use of the authentication setup, you can ignore related information in the 
API quick guide.
